#summary Quick overview of setting up Ubuntu.

= Introduction =

I've installed Ubuntu using the _LAMP server_ option. One then has to make sure that the libcurl3 and php5-curl packages are installed.

In the directory where the extracted files are (if you downloaded the zip) you’ll find *cfg_options.php*. This contains almost all the configurable values. The following values need to be defined:

 * $cfg_option&#91;'user'&#93; – Login Id of the non-privileged account that will used to read all the calendars 
 * $cfg_option[''] - 
 * $cfg_option['authmethod'] – the scripts support both Basic and NTLM authentication when talking to EWS. NTLM required installation of curl 
 * $cfg_option['wsdl'] – path to the appropriate Exchange Web Services WSDL file. 
 * $cfg_option['installpath'] – full path to the scripts 
 * $cfg_option['urlpath'] – URL for the scripts. If the script URL is http://host/ews-cal-rss/getfeed.php this would be “/ews-cal-rss” 

You also need to populate the variable $PFIDs by using the output of the list_calendars.html and also modify the included WSDL files per [WSDLSetup].
